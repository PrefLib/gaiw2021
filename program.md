## Invited Talks

**Speaker:** Michael Wooldridge, University of Oxford

**Title:** Understanding Equilibrium Properties of Multi-Agent Systems

**Abstract:** Over a twenty minute period on the afternoon 6 May 2010, the Dow Jones industrial average collapsed, at one point wiping a trillion dollars off the value of the US markets. Remarkably, the market recovered in a similarly short period of time, to nearly its position before the collapse. While the precise causes of the so-called "Flash Crash" are complex and controversial, the Flash Crash was only possible because modern international markets are multi-agent systems, in which high frequency trading agents autonomously buy and sell on timescales that are so small that they are far beyond human comprehension or control. There is no reason to believe that the 2010 Flash Crash was an isolated event: and the next one could be even bigger, with potentially devastating global consequences. The 2010 Flash Crash provides a stark illustration of something we have long known: that systems composed of large numbers of multiple interacting components can be subject to rapid, unpredictable swings in behaviour.  We urgently need to develop the theory and tools to understand such multi-agent system dynamics.
 
In this talk, I will present two very different approaches to this problem. The first views a multi-agent system as a game, in the sense of game theory, with decision-makers interacting strategically in pursuit of their goals. I describe a model we have developed in which players in such a game act in pursuit of temporal logic goals. In such a setting, the key decision problems relate to the properties of a system that hold under the assumption that players choose strategies in (Nash) equilibrium. I conclude by describing a tool, developed by DPhil student Muhammed Najib, through which we can automatically analyse the properties of such equilibria. The second approach takes a very different approach, in which we use agent-based financial models, involving very large numbers of agents, to understand specifically the factors that can contribute to Flash Crash events, and in particular the phenomenon of "contagion", where stress on one asset leads to other assets being stressed.
 
This talk will report joint work with Ani Calinescu, Julian Gutierrez, Paul Harrenstein, Muhammed Najib, James Paulin, and Giuseppe Perelli.

**Title:** Impartial selection, additive approximation guarantees, and priors

**Abstract:** We study the problem of impartial selection, a topic that lies at the intersection of computational social choice and mechanism design. The goal is to select the most popular individual among a set of community members. The input can be modelled as a directed graph, where each node represents an individual, and a directed edge indicates nomination or approval of a community member to another. An impartial mechanism is robust to potential selfish behaviour of the individuals and provides appropriate incentives to voters to report their true preferences by ensuring that the chance of a node to become a winner does not depend on its outgoing edges. The goal is to design impartial mechanisms that select a node with an in-degree that is as close as possible to the highest in-degree. Recent progress has identified impartial selection rules with optimal approximation ratios. It was noted, though, that worst-case instances are graphs with few vertices. Motivated by this fact, we propose the study of additive approximation, the difference between the highest number of nominations and the number of nominations of the selected member, as an alternative measure of quality. We present randomized impartial selection mechanisms with additive approximation guarantees of o(n), where n is the number of nodes in the input graph. We furthermore demonstrate that prior information on voters' preferences can be useful in the design of simple (deterministic) impartial selection mechanisms with good additive approximation guarantees. In this direction, we consider different models of prior information and analyze the performance of a natural selection mechanism that we call approval voting with default (AVD).

**Title:** Universal growth in production economies

**Abstract:** We consider a simple variant of the von Neumann model of an expanding economy, in which multiple producers make goods according to their production function. The players trade their goods at the market and then use the bundles acquired for the production in the next round. We study a simple decentralized dynamic---known as proportional response---in which players update their bids proportionally to how useful the investments were in the past round. 
We show this dynamic leads to growth of the economy in the long term (whenever growth is possible) but also creates unbounded inequality, i.e. very rich and very poor players emerge. We analyze several other phenomena, such as how the relation of a player with others influences its development and the Gini index of the system. Based on joint work with Ruta Mehta and Noam Nisan.
